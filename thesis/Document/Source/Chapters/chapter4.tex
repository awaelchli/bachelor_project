This chapter is intended to give an overview of the spectral properties and limitations specific to multiplicative light field displays.
Spectral analysis is a crucial method for the quality assessment and it is the origin of a comprehensive understanding of 3D displays. 
A light field emitted by the display can be interpreted as a signal that is composed of sine waves with different amplitude, phase and frequency.
Section~\ref{sec:Definitions} introduces the Fourier transform, an operation that decomposes such a signal into the frequencies that produce it.
The spectral support, i.e. the range of frequencies the display is able to produce, is analyzed in section~\ref{sec:Spectral_Support}. 

\section{Definitions}
\label{sec:Definitions}

The \textbf{Fourier transform} $\hat{f}$ of an integrable function $f \colon \mathbb{R}^n \to \mathbb{C}$ is defined as 
\begin{equation}
	\hat{f}(\xi) = \mathcal{F}(f)(\xi) \coloneqq \int_{\mathbb{R}^n} f(x) e^{-2 \pi \mathrm{i} x \cdot \xi} \, \mathrm{d}x
\end{equation}
for any $\xi \in \mathbb{R}^n$. 
According to the Fourier integral theorem, if both $f$ and $\hat{f}$ are absolutely integrable and $f$ is continuous, then the inverse transform 
\begin{equation}
	f(x) = \mathcal{F}^{-1}(\hat{f})(x) \coloneqq \int_{\mathbb{R}^n} \hat{f}(\xi) e^{2 \pi \mathrm{i} x \cdot \xi} \, \mathrm{d}\xi
\end{equation}
is well defined.
The domain of $f$ is called the \textbf{spatial domain} and the domain of $\hat{f}$ is referred to as the \textbf{frequency domain}.
An important property of the Fourier transform is that a convolution in the spatial domain becomes a multiplication in the frequency domain, or in other words, 
\begin{equation}
	\widehat{(f \ast g)}(\xi) = \hat{f}(\xi) \cdot \hat{g}(\xi)
\end{equation}
for integrable functions $f, g \colon \mathbb{R}^n \to \mathbb{C}$.
On the other hand, a multiplication in the spatial domain becomes a convolution in the frequency domain after applying the Fourier transform, that is
\begin{equation}
	\widehat{(f \cdot g)}(\xi) = (\hat{f} \ast \hat{g})(\xi).
\end{equation}

\section{Spectral Support of Multiplicative Displays}
\label{sec:Spectral_Support}

Consider a scene with a bounded depth range $Z_{\text{min}} \leq Z \leq Z_{\text{max}}$.
In section~\ref{sec:Visualization}, it was shown that an object at a certain depth will be represented in the EPI as a line with a slope proportional to the depth.



Now, consider a single attenuation layer. 
The light field emitted by this layer has constant depth and thus, the lines in the EPI all have the same slope.
