\section{Related work}
The basis of this project are the papers from \cite{WETZ_TOMO, WETZ_TENS}. Additional papers used for the work are: Light Field Rendering by Marc Levoy and Pat Hanrahan, Fourier Slice Photography by Ren Ng, Light Field Photography with a Hand-held Plenoptic Camera by Ren Ng et al. 

\section{Types of light fields}
In this project, I encountered two types of 4D light fields that are captured using camera grids. The most common way of acquiring a light field is to capture a scene with a 2D-grid of cameras where the optical axes of the cameras are orthogonal to the camera grid. Since the look-at-point of each camera is different, this setup will result in a shift in the images formed on the sensors. An alternative way to capture the scene is to fix the look-at-point for every camera, preferably at the origin of the  scene. This is the type of light fields primarily used in the paper from \cite{WETZ_TOMO}.

In addition, the images can be optained using either perspective or orthographic projections. We can also use sheared projections as mentioned in \cite[p.~4]{LEVO_LFREN}.

In a first step, I tried to implement the
